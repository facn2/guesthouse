### Cooking rota
There is a cooking rota on the wall for the coming week. Every day we will have two people cooking dinner. Try to sign up to cook in advance so it is easier to plan the week.

### General kitty
There is a general kitty used to buy food and household essentials such as toilet paper and cleaning products. The current expected contribution is 20 ₪ (šql) per day. There is a chart on the wall outside the kitchen, where each person must tick the days for which they have paid. Each Saturday, we will redraw the chart for the following 7 days. It is important for us to pay into the General Kitty in advance to avoid leaving people out of pocket.

### Beer kitty
The beer is bought from the beer kitty. If you have a beer then put 5 ₪ (šql) in the beer kitty (the blue mug).
