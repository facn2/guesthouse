We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language, imagery or innuendo is not appropriate for any community event, including talks, workshops, parties, Gitter, Twitter and other online media or channels. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and any future events, as well as the from the community itself, at the discretion of the organisers, Founders & Coders.

## Communal living

Communal living means respecting other people all the time.

### Cleaning rotation
There are scheduled cleanings twice a month done by professional cleaners. All the other weeks there is a **cleaning rotation** for all  communal areas.

### Cooking rotation
There is a **cooking rotation** on the wall for the coming week. Every day we will have two people cooking dinner. Try to sign up to cook in advance so it is easier to plan the week. The same people who cooked will also have to clean the dishes and the **kitchen surfaces and floor**.

### General kitty (box)
There is a general kitty **(the box next to the water dispenser)** used to buy food and household essentials such as toilet paper and cleaning products.  There is a chart on the wall outside the kitchen, where each person must tick the days for which they have paid. Each Saturday, we will redraw the chart for the following 7 days. It is important for us to pay into the General Kitty in advance to avoid leaving people out of pocket. **When you have paid make sure to tick your name off the chart, whether you are a resident or an outside guest.**

The current expected contributions are:
- Residents: 20 ₪ (shekels) per day;
- Non-Residents (outside guests): 5₪ for lunch and 10₪ for dinner.

### Alcohol kitty (blue mug)
The alcohol is bought from the alcohol kitty **(the blue mug)**. If you have a can of beer or a glass of wine then put 5 ₪ (shekels) in the kitty. If you have something else please ask for the price.
